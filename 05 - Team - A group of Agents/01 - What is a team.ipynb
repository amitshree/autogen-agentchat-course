    "**When should you use a team?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams are best suited for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complex tasks:** Tasks that require collaboration and diverse expertise.\n",
    "* **Tasks where a single agent proves inadequate:** If a single agent struggles to achieve the desired results, a team approach might be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scaffolding:** Teams require more scaffolding and guidance compared to single agents.\n",
    "* **Start simple:** Begin with a single agent for simpler tasks.\n",
    "* **Optimization:** Ensure your single agent is optimized with appropriate tools and instructions before transitioning to a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a single agent for straightforward tasks. Transition to a multi-agent team when the task's complexity demands collaboration and diverse skills, but be prepared for the increased complexity of managing a team."
