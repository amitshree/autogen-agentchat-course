    "## Streaming Agent Messages with Token Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "You can stream messages generated by an agent in real-time using either `on_messages_stream()` or `run_stream()`. Additionally, you can stream the individual tokens generated by the underlying model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Token Streaming with `model_client_stream=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setting `model_client_stream=True` enables token streaming from the model client.\n",
    "* This will cause the agent to yield `ModelClientStreamingChunkEvent` messages within the `on_messages_stream()` and `run_stream()` generators.\n",
    "* These `ModelClientStreamingChunkEvent` messages contain the individual tokens as they are generated by the model.\n",
    "* This provides a very granular view of the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The underlying model API must support streaming tokens for this feature to function.\n",
    "* Consult your model provider's documentation to confirm token streaming capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `on_messages_stream()`\n",
    "\n",
    "* This method provides an asynchronous generator.\n",
    "* It yields each individual message produced by the agent.\n",
    "* If `model_client_stream=True`, it will also yield `ModelClientStreamingChunkEvent` messages.\n",
    "* The final item yielded is the complete response message, accessible through the `chat_message` attribute.\n",
    "* This allows you to observe the agent's thought process, actions, and token generation as they occur.\n",
    "* For example, you can use `Console` to print these messages to the console as they are generated.\n",
    "* You can observe the agent using tools like `web_search` and see the results that influence its response."
