    "Magentic-One is made up of different agents, each with a specific role in completing tasks. Here’s a simple breakdown of what each agent does:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Orchestrator  \n",
    "The **lead agent** that manages everything. It breaks tasks into smaller steps, assigns them to other agents, tracks progress, and makes adjustments if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. WebSurfer  \n",
    "A **browser-controlling agent** that interacts with a Chromium-based web browser. It can:  \n",
    "- **Navigate** (visit websites, perform searches)  \n",
    "- **Interact** (click buttons, fill forms)  \n",
    "- **Read & Summarize** (extract information, answer questions)  \n",
    "\n",
    "It relies on the browser's **accessibility tree** and **set-of-marks prompting** to understand and interact with web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. FileSurfer  \n",
    "A **file-reading agent** that can open and preview local files (in markdown format) and explore folders. It can:  \n",
    "- Read various file types  \n",
    "- List folder contents  \n",
    "- Navigate directories  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Coder  \n",
    "A **coding agent** that:  \n",
    "- Writes code  \n",
    "- Analyzes data from other agents  \n",
    "- Creates new scripts or programs  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is optimized through system prompts to focus on programming tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. ComputerTerminal  \n",
    "A **console access agent** that:  \n",
    "- Runs the Coder’s programs  \n",
    "- Installs new software or libraries  \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the system to test and execute code in a real development environment.\n",
