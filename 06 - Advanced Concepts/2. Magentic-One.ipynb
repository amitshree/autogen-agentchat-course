    "## 1. Orchestrator  \n",
    "The **lead agent** that manages everything. It breaks tasks into smaller steps, assigns them to other agents, tracks progress, and makes adjustments if needed.\n",

    "## 2. WebSurfer  \n",
    "A **browser-controlling agent** that interacts with a Chromium-based web browser. It can:  \n",
    "- **Navigate** (visit websites, perform searches)  \n",
    "- **Interact** (click buttons, fill forms)  \n",
    "- **Read & Summarize** (extract information, answer questions)  \n",
    "\n",
    "It relies on the browser's **accessibility tree** and **set-of-marks prompting** to understand and interact with web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. FileSurfer  \n",
    "A **file-reading agent** that can open and preview local files (in markdown format) and explore folders. It can:  \n",
    "- Read various file types  \n",
    "- List folder contents  \n",
    "- Navigate directories  \n",

    "## 4. Coder  \n",
    "A **coding agent** that:  \n",
    "- Writes code  \n",
    "- Analyzes data from other agents  \n",
    "- Creates new scripts or programs  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is optimized through system prompts to focus on programming tasks.\n",

      "Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the …\n",

However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the …\\nTotal citations\\nCited by 9592022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n3\\n160\\n671\\n122\\nScholar articles\\nEvidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault toleranceY Kim, A Eddins, S Anand, KX Wei, E Van Den Berg… - Nature, 2023\\nCited by 959 \\nRelated articles \\nAll 15 versionsPrivacy\\nTerms\\nHelp\\nAbout Scholar\\nSearch help\\n\\nThe following metadata was extracted from the webpage:\\n\\n{\\n    \"meta_tags\": {\\n        \"referrer\": \"origin-when-cross-origin\",\\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=2\",\\n        \"format-detection\": \"telephone=no\",\\n        \"description\": \"\\\\u202aY Kim, A Eddins, S Anand, KX Wei, E Van Den Berg, S Rosenblatt, H Nayfeh, Y Wu, M Zaletel, K Temme\\\\u2026\\\\u202c, \\\\u202aNature, 2023\\\\u202c - \\\\u202aCited by 959\\\\u202c\",\\n        \"og:description\": \"\\\\u202aY Kim, A Eddins, S Anand, KX Wei, E Van Den Berg, S Rosenblatt, H Nayfeh, Y Wu, M Zaletel, K Temme\\\\u2026\\\\u202c, \\\\u202aNature, 2023\\\\u202c - \\\\u202aCited by 959\\\\u202c\",\\n        \"og:title\": \"\\\\u202aEvidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance\\\\u202c\",\\n        \"og:image\": \"\",\\n        \"og:type\": \"website\",\\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary\"\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nHere is a screenshot of the page.', <autogen_core._image.Image object at 0x11465a000>], type='MultiModalMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='Please find and access another recent research paper related to quantum computing, and summarize its key findings.', type='TextMessage'), MultiModalMessage(source='WebSurfer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=6936, completion_tokens=45), metadata={}, content=['I typed \\'latest research paper on quantum computing 2023 site:arxiv.org\\' into the browser search bar.\\n\\nThe web browser is open to the page [latest research paper on quantum computing 2023 site:arxiv.org - بحث](https://www.bing.com/search?q=latest+research+paper+on+quantum+computing+2023+site%3Aarxiv.org&FORM=QBLH).\\nThe viewport shows 41% of the webpage, and is positioned at the top of the page\\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\\n\\nتخطى إلى المحتوى\\nlatest research paper on quantum computing 2023 site:arxiv.orgبحث عميق\\nالجميع\\nCopilot\\nصور\\nمقاطع فيديو\\nالخرائط\\nالمزيد\\nأدوات\\nحوالي 1٬170٬000 من النتائج تقريباًarXiv.org\\nhttps://arxiv.org › abs\\n[2403.02240] Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges - arXiv.org23 شعبان 1445 بعد الهجرة · \\nTo better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area.

These quantum features help solve many complex problems that cannot be solved otherwise with conventional computing methods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, chemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable progress in quantum software and algorithm creation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the prospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry.
