    "# Selector Group Chat  \n",
    "\n",
    "`SelectorGroupChat` is a dynamic team-based chat system where participants take turns broadcasting messages to all other members. Unlike traditional round-robin approaches, it leverages a generative model (e.g., an LLM) to intelligently select the next speaker based on the ongoing conversation, enabling more context-aware and adaptive interactions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligent Speaker Selection** – A model-driven approach determines the most relevant next speaker.  \n",
    "- **Configurable Roles & Descriptions** – Define unique roles and attributes for each participant.  \n",
    "- **Turn Management** – Prevents consecutive turns by the same speaker (optional).  \n",
    "- **Flexible Selection Process** – Customize the selection prompt and override the model’s decision with a custom function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works  \n",
    "\n",
    "`SelectorGroupChat` builds upon the structure of `RoundRobinGroupChat` but introduces a model-based mechanism for selecting the next speaker. When a task is initiated through `run()` or `run_stream()`, the following steps occur:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context Analysis & Speaker Selection  \n",
    "   - The system evaluates the conversation history and participant attributes (e.g., name, description).  \n",
    "   - A model determines the most suitable next speaker.  \n",
    "   - By default, the same speaker is not selected twice in a row unless they are the only available agent. This behavior can be modified using `allow_repeated_speaker=True`.  \n",
    "   - You can also override the model-based selection by providing a custom selection function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Generating & Broadcasting the Response  \n",
    "   - The selected speaker generates a response.  \n",
    "   - The response is shared with all other participants.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Checking for Termination  \n",
    "   - The system evaluates whether the conversation should end based on predefined termination conditions.  \n",
    "   - If the conversation is still active, the process repeats from Step 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Returning the Final Result  \n",
    "   - Once the conversation concludes, the system returns a `TaskResult` containing the complete conversation history.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures an adaptive, context-driven collaboration experience, making `SelectorGroupChat` ideal for scenarios requiring structured yet flexible interactions.  "
