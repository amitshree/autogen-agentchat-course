    "There are two main ways to provide feedback to the team while using your application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **During a run** – Use a `UserProxyAgent` while `run()` or `run_stream()` is executing.  \n",
    "2. **After a run ends** – Provide feedback as input when calling `run()` or `run_stream()` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Providing Feedback During a Run\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UserProxyAgent` is a special built-in agent that allows users to give feedback to the team while it is running.\n",

    "### How to Use the `UserProxyAgent`\n",
    "- Create an instance of `UserProxyAgent`.  \n",
    "- Add it to the team before starting the run.  \n",
    "- The team will decide when to ask for user feedback through the `UserProxyAgent`.\n",

    "### When is `UserProxyAgent` Called?\n",
    "- **In a RoundRobinGroupChat team** – It is called in the order it was added to the team.  \n",
    "- **In a SelectorGroupChat team** – The selector prompt or function decides when the `UserProxyAgent` is called.  \n"

It could have an option for audio narration, allowing users to listen to the story as it unfolds. This could also encourage creativity and community involvement.\n",
