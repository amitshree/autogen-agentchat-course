    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **`chat_message`:**\n",
    "    * This attribute stores the agent's final, conclusive response. It represents the ultimate answer or output the agent has generated based on the input message and its internal processing.\n",
    "    * Think of it as the agent's final statement or conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`inner_messages`:**\n",
    "    * This attribute contains a list of messages that document the agent's internal reasoning process.\n",
    "    * It effectively reveals the agent's \"thought process,\" showing the steps, considerations, and tool usages that led to the final `chat_message`.\n",
    "    * By examining `inner_messages`, you can gain insights into how the agent arrived at its conclusion, allowing for debugging, analysis, and a deeper understanding of its behavior."

    "## Important Note: `on_messages()` and Agent State\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding State Updates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to understand that the `on_messages()` method modifies the agent's internal state. Specifically, each call to `on_messages()` appends the provided messages to the agent's message history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoid Redundant Calls:**\n",
    "    * Repeatedly calling `on_messages()` with the same messages or the entire history will result in duplicate entries in the agent's history. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially degrade performance.\n",
    "* **Use New Messages:**\n",
    "    * To ensure proper functioning and accurate agent responses, always call `on_messages()` with *new* messages that represent the next step in the interaction. Do not send comple user-assistent interaction.\n",
    "* **Maintaining Context:**\n",
    "    * The agent uses its message history to maintain context during conversations. Therefore, avoid adding uneeded duplicate messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, treat `on_messages()` as a method that advances the agent's conversation and knowledge. Do not use it to replay or reiterate past interactions.**"

    "## The `run()` Method: A Convenience Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `on_messages()`, you can utilize the `run()` method for interacting with the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Convenience Method:**\n",
    "    * The `run()` method acts as a simplified, high-level interface that internally calls `on_messages()`. This provides a more streamlined way to execute agent interactions.\n",
    "* **Teams Interface Compatibility:**\n",
    "    * The `run()` method is designed to follow the same interface as the `Teams` object. This consistency simplifies integration and promotes a unified approach to agent interactions.\n",
    "* **`TaskResult` Object:**\n",
    "    * Instead of returning a `Response` object like `on_messages()`, `run()` returns a `TaskResult` object.\n",
    "    * The `TaskResult` object provides a structured representation of the agent's execution, encapsulating the outcome and relevant details of the task.\n",
    "    * This task result object can be used to more easily access the results of an agents actions."
