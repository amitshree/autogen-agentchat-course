    "# Multi-Agent AI Chatbot for Customer Support\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The **Multi-Agent AI Chatbot for Customer Support** is a conversational AI system that utilizes multiple specialized agents to handle customer inquiries related to product information, order placement, order status, and complaint registration. The chatbot is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend, **FastAPI** for the backend, and **Autogen's multi-agent framework** for task delegation and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Product Inquiry:** Users can ask about product details such as price and stock availability.\n",
    "- **Order Placement:** Users can place orders for available products.\n",
    "- **Order Status Tracking:** Users can check the status of their existing orders.\n",
    "- **Complaint Registration:** Users can report issues related to their orders.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Agents coordinate tasks using the **Autogen** framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technology Stack\n",
    "- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python-based UI framework)\n",
    "- **Backend:** FastAPI (Lightweight and efficient API framework)\n",
    "- **AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o (via Autogen framework)\n",
    "- **Database:** In-memory dictionaries for product catalog, orders, and complaints (can be replaced with a persistent database)\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "1. **Streamlit Frontend (app.py):**\n",
    "   - Provides an interactive chat interface.\n",
    "   - Sends user queries to the FastAPI backend.\n",
    "   - Displays chatbot responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FastAPI Backend (team_api.py):**\n",
    "   - Handles incoming requests from the frontend.\n",
    "   - Calls the multi-agent system to process user queries.\n",
    "   - Returns chatbot responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent System (teams.py):**\n",
    "   - Uses **Autogen's SelectorGroupChat** to enable structured conversation between agents.\n",
    "   - **PlanningAgent** assigns user queries to specialized agents:\n",
    "     - **ProductInquiryAgent:** Retrieves product details.\n",
    "     - **OrderPlacementAgent:** Places orders.\n",
    "     - **OrderInquiryAgent:** Checks order status.\n",
    "     - **ComplaintAgent:** Registers complaints.\n",
    "     - **ResponseAgent:** Formats responses for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. A user enters a query in the Streamlit chat UI.\n",
    "2. The frontend sends the request to the FastAPI backend.\n",
    "3. The **multi-agent system** processes the query:\n",
    "   - The **PlanningAgent** identifies the correct agent for the task.\n",
    "   - The assigned agent executes the task using predefined tools.\n",
    "   - The **ResponseAgent** formats and delivers the final response.\n",
    "4. The chatbot response is displayed in the Streamlit UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example User Queries\n",
    "- *\"What is the price of Apple iPhone 15 Pro?\"*\n",
    "- *\"I want to buy 2 Dell XPS 15 laptops.\"*\n",
    "- *\"Check my order status for Order ID: ORD-2.\"*\n",
    "- *\"I received a defective product, and I want to raise a complaint.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Enhancements\n",
    "- **Integration with a database** for persistent storage of orders and complaints.\n",
    "- **Voice interaction support** for better accessibility.\n",
    "- **Multi-language support** for a global user base.\n",
    "- **Enhanced NLP capabilities** for better query understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Application\n",
