    "# Installing Python 3.12\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide provides instructions for installing Python 3.12 on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the installer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)\n",
    "   * Download the appropriate *Windows installer (64-bit)*.  32-bit is extremely rare these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the installer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Double-click the downloaded executable file.\n",
    "   * **Crucial:** Ensure you check the box that says \"Add Python 3.12 to PATH\" during the installation process. This is essential for running Python from the command prompt or PowerShell.\n",
    "   * You can choose to \"Install Now\" for a standard installation, or \"Customize installation\" if you need more control.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Open the command prompt (search for \"cmd\" in the Start Menu) or PowerShell.\n",
    "   * Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see output similar to `Python 3.12.x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS already comes with Python, but it's typically an older version and *not* recommended for development. We'll install a newer version alongside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies software installation. If you don't have it, open Terminal and paste the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh))\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Python 3.12 using Homebrew:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In Terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     brew install python@3.12\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Open Terminal and type `python3.12 --version`. You should see `Python 3.12.x`.  Crucially, you'll use `python3.12` to invoke this version.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set Python 3.12 as the default (Recommended):**\n",
    "   * Open your .bash_profile file in a text editor. If it doesn't exist, create it. `nano ~/.bash_profile`  # Or use your preferred editor (e.g., vim, emacs) and add these 2 lines\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   alias python=python3\n",
    "   alias pip=pip3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux distributions vary significantly. The most robust approach is often building from source, but package managers are usually more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a Package Manager (Generally Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Mint, Debian):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  sudo apt update\n",
    "  sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-dev  # The -dev package is VERY important for development\n",
